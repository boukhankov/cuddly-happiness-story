It was a dark and stormy night. Because of Cloudy.
See, Cloudy was a big, bad storm cloud. Who wanted nothing to do with being happy and joyful. All he did was going around blocking out the sky with his
steel gray curves, and rain all over whatever was below him. One time, the City of Madison, Wisconsin had a magnificent parade in honor of 
becoming one of the top party schools in the nation. And he rained all over it. Not only that, he hated all other clouds. Wispy, floaty ones that come out 
during hot summer days. Poofy white clouds that people like to look up at and imagine them being all these cute and cuddly things. Disgusting. Cloudy would never
be like one of them. He wasn't envious of them at all. At all.
