It was a dark and stormy night. Because of Cloudy. See, Cloudy was a big, bad storm cloud. Who wanted nothing to do with being happy and joyful. All he did 
was going around blocking out the sky with his steel gray curves, and rain all over whatever was below him. One time, the City of Madison, Wisconsin had a 
magnificent parade in honor of becoming one of the top party schools in the nation. And he rained all over it. Not only that, he hated all other clouds. 
Wispy, floaty ones that come out during hot summer days. Poofy white clouds that people like to look up at and imagine them being all these cute and cuddly 
things. Disgusting. Cloudy would never be like one of them. He wasn't envious of them at all. At all.

Cloud being the nefarious schemer he was began planning out his attack on the city of Madison. He saw it as the only way he could get rid of the sheer 
digust he was filled with. "I will drown them all in my fury" he thought. But Cloudy may have been a big and bad storm cloud, but he still didn't have 
enough water to execute his scheme so he went over Lake Mendota. He knew it would take a few days to collect all the water he needed - so for now all he 
could do was wait it out as he was filled more and more with disgust watching those clouds cuddle.

As he waited, one day, a young cloud nymph came over to Cloudy, taken aback by his actions. He couldn't just empty the entire lake! How would people survive 
without access to this water? They needed it for recreation, drinking and showering, and just to keep the environment a safe place. Angrily, they warned 
Cloudy that Zeus, the Greek God of the Skies would hear about this, and he would be angered by his actions. Yet careless and rueful as he was, Cloudy 
ignored these warnings and continued to stand over Lake Mendota. He would take his revenge!
